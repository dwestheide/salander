# salander

This is a proof-of-concept of a mutation testing tool for Scala. Its goal is to demonstrate the basic idea of how mutation testing works and to show how [Scalameta](https://github.com/scalameta/scalameta) and [SBT](https://github.com/sbt/sbt) can help with implementing such a tool.

As such, this project is solely meant for education purposes, without aiming ot be used for more than experiments.

_salander_ got its name from a spell of transformation in the popular German tabletop roleplaying game _The Dark Eye_: 

_Salander Mutanderer, sei an anderer!_

A few parts of this proof-of-concept are heavily inspired by [stryker4s](https://github.com/stryker-mutator/stryker4s), a project aiming to bring mutation testing to real-world Scala projects.
